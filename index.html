    <p>Heart failure called congestive heart failure occurs when your heart muscle cannot draw blood properly. Certain conditions, such as narrowing of your heart's arteries or high blood pressure, can make your heart weak or stiff and unable to effectively fill and pump blood.

    <p>A heart attack is because of blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle. Without blood, tissue loses oxygen and dies. When arterial obstruction reduces or stops blood flow to the heart, deoxygenated can damage or kill the heart muscle, causing heart disease.
